# dungen
DunGen is a JavaScript web app for procedural generation of paper and pencil old school pointcrawl dungeons displayed and edited using vis.js.

It will probably be of interest mainly to gamers that like OSR RPGs. 

It runs at http://meta-studios.com/dg/dungen.html. Discussion is mostly on G+ and my Ruminations of a Geek blog linked at the top of the app page.
