DunGen is a JavaScript web app for procedural generation of paper and pencil old school pointcrawl dungeons displayed and edited using vis.js.

It will probably be of interest mainly to gamers that like OSR RPGs. 

It runs at http://meta-studios.com/dg/dungen.html. Discussion is mostly on G+ and my Ruminations of a Geek blog linked at the top of the app page.

Dunmap is a second page that shares most of the same JS code. You load a bitmap image of the map and place markers by clicking on it. It generates contents for each marker as it is created.  http://meta-studios.com/dg/dunmap.html

Both allow editing of previously generated content and in browser storage using LocalStorage, giving a lightweight UI for quickly building paper and pencil dungeon crawls.
